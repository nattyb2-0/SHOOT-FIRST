# SHOOT-FIRST
My very 1st class and coding project!!!


My very first class and coding project. I am tasked with coming up with a game that has 2 pages....A landing page(which replicates something that already exist online) and the game page. I've chosen to develop a first person shooter game. the game is going to be a single player game in which speed and accuracy determines the player score. Images are going to pop up randomly and the player is tasked with shooting only the images that are of danger(enemies with guns). there will be images of friendlies and civillians that flas across the screen as well. If the player hits these targets, points will be deducted from his overall score. The game is clock based.

I plan to approach this game by developing a barebone minimal viable product with little to know functionality 1st, and then adding on and developing features as i go along.

i learned valuable lessons while doing this lesson. For starters, i spent way too much time working on features that were not important. Furthermore, i spent too much time trying to add features to the game that were already working, instead of making sure the game was properly working first, and then going back to add on.

I plan to continue working on this game long past this day, i seen a few interesting issues that i would like to work on in my spare time. includng but not limited to creating levels. I ran into a major problem trying to do this as i couldnt escape the loop once condition was met and it kept adding time to the game, causing it to continue indefinetly.
